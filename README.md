## 🎮 ARC Raiders-Inspired Health System

Taking inspiration from Embark Studios' acclaimed **ARC Raiders**, our health system focuses on **visual feedback over numbers**. Instead of cluttered stat displays, the HUD communicates your status through intuitive, animated bars that feel alive.

### How It Works

**Segmented Shield & Health Bars**

- 5-sector segmented design for clear visual chunking
- Shield bar (top) absorbs damage before health
- Health bar (bottom) shows your vital status
- Each segment represents 20% — know your status at a glance

**Dynamic Damage Feedback**

- **Damage trailing** — When hit, a red "ghost bar" lingers showing damage taken, then smoothly catches down to your actual health
- **Screen shake** — Subtle shake effect on damage for visceral feedback
- **Color flash** — Bars and borders flash red momentarily on impact
- No floating numbers or damage text — just clean visual communication

**Healing & Shield Regeneration**

- **Animated fill stripes** — Green diagonal stripes animate across health when healing
- **Orange stripes** for shield regeneration
- **Step-based animation** — Health fills in satisfying increments, not instant jumps
- Visual feedback that feels rewarding without being distracting
